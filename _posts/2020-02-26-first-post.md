A new Digital Practicum has started and I couldn't be more excited. Each class will provide a hands-on walkthrough on different digital tools, which can be extremely useful to find out new possibilities for our individual projects and to get familiar with new digital tools and skills. 

While I had a great time in my first practicum in 2022, after the class was over, I didn't touch my github page (shame on me). Therefore, in addition to the  development of new skills, I see this course as an opportunity to keep working on my github in order to make it not just a record of my learning process but also to (finally) build it into my professional page and a repository for my digital humanities porfolio.
